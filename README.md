That's it. That's all my exp. I'm level 1 bro.
Stop yelling at me. 😭

***Why now & why vibe code?***

Due to video games being shit & Windows 11 forcing AI into legit everything (even the file explorer, man, like, come on dude, give me my RAM back), I no longer play games, I can actually see Windows get more & more sluggish every update, and I also have a hobby hole to fill with one old & one newish gaming PC collecting dust. Then I got an idea....
Why not ***Homelab***?
And so begins the massive learning curve of moving from Windows to Linux and learning CLI, shell, bash, py, ps1, etc., without any schooling or external interpersonal help from an actual teacher that teaches this kind of shit for a living.
So I kinda have to use YouTube to study.

- But you can't ask videos questions.
- Googling for a coherent explanation can take hours. +Plus, I'm dyslexic as fuck, so fuck reading books, man.
- So I kinda have to use a AI as an alternative. 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️

## Learning via self-study

Using **YouTube** for lessons/ideas & public ***Git*** repositories for example ***scripts*** with the help of AI for explanations of and/or generation of ***snippets*** to get me started, ***error*** fixes, etc.
The most coding I had done before **2025** was like videogame settings, a mod for Fallout 4 to change a texture.
**2025** however I messed with Docker to see if I could run an AI at home & connect when out and about for funzies.
Worked great too aside from the secrets left all over the repository **lmao**.
